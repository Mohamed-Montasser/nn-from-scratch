# NN-from-scratch

**Build Your Own Neural Network Library & Advanced Applications**
*MCT Program — CSE473s: Computational Intelligence (Fall 2025)*

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository will host our implementation of a **neural network library from scratch** using only **Python and NumPy**.
The project will later include:

1. A modular NN library (layers, activations, loss functions, optimizer, model class).
2. A demo solving the **XOR problem** using our custom library.
3. An **autoencoder** for MNIST image reconstruction.
4. Using the trained encoder as a **feature extractor** for SVM classification.
5. A comparison against **TensorFlow/Keras** implementations.

## 🚀 Project Goals

* Understand foundational NN mathematics (forward/backward propagation).
* Implement essential components:

  * Dense layer, activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax)
  * Loss functions (MSE)
  * Optimizer (SGD)
  * Sequential/Network model
* Validate the library through unit tests & gradient checking.
* Build an autoencoder and evaluate reconstruction quality.
* Use latent features for SVM classification.
* Compare performance with TensorFlow/Keras.
